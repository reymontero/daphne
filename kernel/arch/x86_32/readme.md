# x86_32
Daphne only offers partial support for 32 bit machines. Namely, daphne will only ever use text mode in these machines, as I can't be bothered to write stupid hacks involving v86 mode and the like. Daphne will also only ever boot on legacy BIOS on 32 bit machines, as there is no point of adding UEFI support for these older machines.
