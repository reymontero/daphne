# <p style="text-align:center"> phiOS </p>
A non-UNIX x86-32 (and hopefully x86-64 in the future) operating system just like all others.

# Building from source
The only dependency for building phiOS is the `i686-elf-*` GCC toolchain and a UNIX-like environment. To build this toolchain from source, run `./scripts/toolchain.sh`. To build the kernel, see `./phiOS.sh -help`.

# Contribute
In order to contribute code, you must open a pull request. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` before doing anything.
