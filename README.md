# phiOS
Just another 32bit hobby operating system!
Check it out over at my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzXuqt4_pAogDUzy3RpN9nQ), I guess?

# Building from source
The only dependency for building phiOS is the `i686-elf-*` GCC toolchain and a UNIX-like environment. See `./phiOS.sh -help` for assistance.
